title: "Gren 25S: Easier interop, concurrent tasks and zero-install packages"
published: "2025-07-21"

A new version of the Gren programming language is now available! There are no syntax changes in this release, but there are still major features to talk about. Task ports simplify interop with JavaScript. Tasks now run concurrently. Packages can now easily be committed to version control, and the compiler now let you run helper programs defined in packages.

## What do we mean by 25S?

Twice a year we release backward incompatible changes of the compiler and the core packages, all of which have their own version number.

25S, or the 2025 Summer release, consists of the following software:

* compiler v0.6.0
* gren-lang/core v7.0.0
* gren-lang/browser v6.0.0
* gren-lang/node v6.0.0

## Task ports

Ports is the mechanism we use to send values between JavaScript and Gren _without_ sacrificing
Gren's guarantee of immutability and managed side effects.

One limitation of ports is that you can only define `Cmd` (sending a message from Gren to JavaScript) and `Sub` (JavaScript to Gren) ports.
If you wanted to send a value to JavaScript and immediately get a response, you'd have to model that with two ports.

As an example, if you wanted to use JavaScript to store a value in a database and get the ID of that saved value in return, you'd start by
defining two ports: one for storing the value, and one for receiving the result:

```elm
port saveToDB : String -> Cmd msg
port valueWasSaved : (String -> msg) -> Sub msg
```

On the JavaScript side, you'd setup these ports as follows:

```js
const { Gren } = require('./app.js');
const db = require("db");

const app = Gren.Main.init({});

app.ports.saveToDB.subscribe((value) => {
  db.save(value, (err, id) => {
    if (err !== null) {
      app.ports.valueWasSaved.send(id);
    }
  })
})
```

The above code will work, but has two problems. First, when an ID is received we don't know which command
it is a response to. Second, we're currently just ignoring errors. Both of these problems are solvable,
but the best solution will depend on your specific use case.

In Gren 25S, we've made this pattern a bit easier by allowing you to define task ports.

Defining the port itself is simple enough:

```elm
port saveToDB : String -> Task Json.Decode.Value Int
```

In JavaScript you can define the task port implementation like so:

```js
const { Gren } = require('./app.js');

Gren.Main.init({
  taskPorts: {
    myTaskPort: async function(str) {
      return str.length;
    }
  }
})
```

Task ports must be implemented as async functions, or functions returning promises on the JS side. If anything goes wrong,
like an exception being thrown, it will be represented as a failed task in Gren, with the exception represented as a JSON
value.

Task ports reduces the amount of code you need to write, especially considering that you don't need The Elm Architecture to
handle the `Sub`-based port. It also solves both of the problems we mentioned earlier.

## Concurrent tasks

[Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task) is what we use to perform managed side effects, like performing a HTTP call.

If you wanted to perform multiple tasks, you were limited to either perform these sequentially (one after another) _or_
turn them into commands that could be run concurrently using [Cmd.batch](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd#batch). This later option required you to deal with the responses
using The Elm Architecture, which can be a lot of work in certain cases.

With this release, tasks defined using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2), [Task.map3](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map3) or [Task.andMap](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#andMap) will run concurrently without the use of [Cmd.batch](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd#batch).
There's also a [Task.concurrent](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#concurrent) function for executing a whole array of tasks concurrently. [Task.sequence](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#sequence) is still available for
when you want to perform tasks one after another, but can also be combined with [Task.concurrent](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#concurrent) to reduce the amount of concurrency
happening at any given time.

Do note that concurrency _is not_ paralellism. Concurrency allows you to wait for multiple things at the same time, while paralellism allows
you to _do_ multiple things at the same time. Using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2) with two HTTP requests will now be faster, but using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2) to compute
two separate things will have the same performance as before.

This feature was contributed by [Andrew MacMurray](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray).

## Zero-install package management

When compiling projects, the compiler will now store dependencies as gzipped files in a `gren_packages` folder at the root of your project.
We recommend that you commit this folder to version control, as it will allow your project to compile even if you don't have network access.
It will also mean that you don't have to download dependencies unless you're adding them to your project for the first time.

This feature was part of a rewrite of the package manager. It is now written in Gren itself, and some of the underlying functionality
is available in the [compiler-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/compiler-node/version/3.0.1/overview) package.

## Gren run

As a convenience, there is now a command to compile _and_ execute an application:

```
gren run Main
```

You can use this as a simple way to run your test suite:

```
gren run Tests
```

That might not sound like much, but if you add a `--package` flag, you'll be able to execute
helper applications defined in packages, almost like using `npx` in the Node.js ecosystem.

This allows you to do things like define initializers for your package:

```
gren run --package=xyz/cool-framework Setup
```

And you do not need to be in a Gren project to run this!

## Misc. changes

`gren path` is a new command that prints paths that are important during compilation: the path to the current
project, the backend binary being used and the cache folder.

In 24W we added a command, `gren make-static`, to allow you to create static executables. This command relied
on some JavaScript dependencies used through ports, but since you cannot create static executables when ports
are involved, this meant that the compiler itself couldn't use this functionality. We've now removed this functionality
from the compiler itself, and instead published the [gren-make-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gren-make-static)
package to NPM that provides the same functionality. In the future, we might ship static executable builds of the
compiler through `nix`.

While adding support for concurrent tasks, [Andrew MacMurray](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray) also found a way to optimize the execution of tasks
and commands. You can expect better performance when running a large number of tasks and commands.

You can now also unwrap [Cmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd) from a `Task x (Cmd a)` type using [Task.executeCmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#executeCmd). This makes it possible
to end a [Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task) chain with a [Cmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd), giving you a limited way to combine such effects.

Mapping functions over more than three values (`map4`, `map5`, etc.) have been removed from most modules,
with an exception made for the JSON modules. If you ever want to map more than three values at a time, we've
added `andMap` to enable that.

There's a new module called [Stream.Log](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Stream.Log) that ignores any error that occurs when sending a value to the Stream.
In general, we recommend that you only use this module for logging to the `stdout` or `stderr` streams, and use the regular `Stream`
module for most other cases where errors are more likely to occur.

[Joey Bright](https://github.com/joeybright) has made several improvements to the [Crypto API](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Crypto) in response to user feedback. There are no
new features, but the types are more correct.

You can now listen for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals in applications targetting the `node` platform. You can
also listen for the event where the JS event loop runs out of work.

Filesystem errors now carries the relevant `Path`, which tends to be useful for error reporting or debugging.

## What's next

With Gren 25S out the door, our attention shifts to 25W wich we aim to ship in December. The goal for that
release is to rewrite the language parser in Gren itself, re-introduce `gren format` and finish the
centralized package registry.

With the parser rewrite, the AST will be made available in [compiler-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/compiler-node/version/3.0.1/overview). Formatting will be available
as a `AST -> String` function, which will also open the door for code generation.
