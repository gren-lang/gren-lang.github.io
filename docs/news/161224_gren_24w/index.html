It wants to help you write correct software by being your assistant, pointing out likely mistakes as you write code. Finally, it tries to be available wherever you need it to be, so that you can use it to write CLI tools, backend- or even frontend applications.\\n\\nThere already exist a language that is close to matching this description: [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). What Elm lacks is better support for Web API's, and official support for running outside the browser.\\n\\nWhile we could spend considerable time and effort in creating a language which would look very similar to Elm, we've instead decided to fork the compiler and core packages, and use that as the basis of Gren.\\n\\n### Differences from Elm\\n\\nIf you already know Elm, then you also know Gren. Even the core packages are similar. That said, there are some differences:\\n\\n* A git-based package manager. It's slower, but has access to any github repo that you have, even private ones.\\n* Extended support for pattern matching on records.\\n* The default sequential data structure is an immutable array, not a linked list.\\n* No tuples.\\n* No automatic constructors for type aliased records.\\n* No GLSL syntax.\\n* No reactor.\\n\\nIf you have no experience with Elm, you can read more about the language in our official [guide](/learn). If you'd like to try it out, you can find instructions on getting started [here](/install).\\n\\nVersion 0.1.0 is considered to be an alpha release. While you can write production quality software with it today, there are likely bugs in the compiler and core packages, and breaking changes are planned for the next release.\\n\\nIf you like what you see, consider joining the [community](/community). We can use all the help we can get.\\n\\n### Looking forward\\n\\nGren follows a six-month release cadence. The next release will be v0.2.0 and be made available in December.\\n\\nThe plan is to add support for more Web API's and basic support for applications running on the NodeJS runtime. In addition, the package manager will become more efficient and reliable.\\n\\n### Thank you, contributors\\n\\nThis release of Gren was made possible by people who've written new code, ported packages from Elm and provided valuable feedback on [Zulip](https://gren.zulipchat.com).

There are no syntax changes in this release, but there are still major features to talk about. Task ports simplify interop with JavaScript. Tasks now run concurrently. Packages can now easily be committed to version control, and the compiler now let you run helper programs defined in packages.\\n\\n## What do we mean by 25S?\\n\\nTwice a year we release backward incompatible changes of the compiler and the core packages, all of which have their own version number.\\n\\n25S, or the 2025 Summer release, consists of the following software:\\n\\n* compiler v0.6.0\\n* gren-lang/core v7.0.0\\n* gren-lang/browser v6.0.0\\n* gren-lang/node v6.0.0\\n\\n## Task ports\\n\\nPorts is the mechanism we use to send values between JavaScript and Gren _without_ sacrificing\\nGren's guarantee of immutability and managed side effects.\\n\\nOne limitation of ports is that you can only define `Cmd` (sending a message from Gren to JavaScript) and `Sub` (JavaScript to Gren) ports.\\nIf you wanted to send a value to JavaScript and immediately get a response, you'd have to model that with two ports.\\n\\nAs an example, if you wanted to use JavaScript to store a value in a database and get the ID of that saved value in return, you'd start by\\ndefining two ports: one for storing the value, and one for receiving the result:\\n\\n```elm\\nport saveToDB : String -> Cmd msg\\nport valueWasSaved : (String -> msg) -> Sub msg\\n```\\n\\nOn the JavaScript side, you'd setup these ports as follows:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { Gren } = require('./app.js');\\nconst db = require(\\\"db\\\");\\n\\nconst app = Gren.Main.init({});\\n\\napp.ports.saveToDB.subscribe((value) => {\\n  db.save(value, (err, id) => {\\n    if (err !== null) {\\n      app.ports.valueWasSaved.send(id);\\n    }\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe above code will work, but has two problems. First, when an ID is received we don't know which command\\nit is a response to. Second, we're currently just ignoring errors. Both of these problems are solvable,\\nbut the best solution will depend on your specific use case.\\n\\nIn Gren 25S, we've made this pattern a bit easier by allowing you to define task ports.\\n\\nDefining the port itself is simple enough:\\n\\n```elm\\nport saveToDB : String -> Task Json.Decode.Value Int\\n```\\n\\nIn JavaScript you can define the task port implementation like so:\\n\\n```js\\nconst { Gren } = require('./app.js');\\n\\nGren.Main.init({\\n  taskPorts: {\\n    myTaskPort: async function(str) {\\n      return str.length;\\n    }\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nTask ports must be implemented as async functions, or functions returning promises on the JS side. If anything goes wrong,\\nlike an exception being thrown, it will be represented as a failed task in Gren, with the exception represented as a JSON\\nvalue.\\n\\nTask ports reduces the amount of code you need to write, especially considering that you don't need The Elm Architecture to\\nhandle the `Sub`-based port. It also solves both of the problems we mentioned earlier.\\n\\n## Concurrent tasks\\n\\n[Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task) is what we use to perform managed side effects, like performing a HTTP call.\\n\\nIf you wanted to perform multiple tasks, you were limited to either perform these sequentially (one after another) _or_\\nturn them into commands that could be run concurrently using [Cmd.batch](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd#batch). This later option required you to deal with the responses\\nusing The Elm Architecture, which can be a lot of work in certain cases.\\n\\nWith this release, tasks defined using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2), [Task.map3](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map3) or [Task.andMap](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#andMap) will run concurrently without the use of [Cmd.batch](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd#batch).\\nThere's also a [Task.concurrent](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#concurrent) function for executing a whole array of tasks concurrently. [Task.sequence](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#sequence) is still available for\\nwhen you want to perform tasks one after another, but can also be combined with [Task.concurrent](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#concurrent) to reduce the amount of concurrency\\nhappening at any given time.\\n\\nDo note that concurrency _is not_ paralellism. Concurrency allows you to wait for multiple things at the same time, while paralellism allows\\nyou to _do_ multiple things at the same time. Using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2) with two HTTP requests will now be faster, but using [Task.map2](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#map2) to compute\\ntwo separate things will have the same performance as before.\\n\\nThis feature was contributed by [Andrew MacMurray](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray).\\n\\n## Zero-install package management\\n\\nWhen compiling projects, the compiler will now store dependencies as gzipped files in a `gren_packages` folder at the root of your project.\\nWe recommend that you commit this folder to version control, as it will allow your project to compile even if you don't have network access.\\nIt will also mean that you don't have to download dependencies unless you're adding them to your project for the first time.\\n\\nThis feature was part of a rewrite of the package manager. It is now written in Gren itself, and some of the underlying functionality\\nis available in the [compiler-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/compiler-node/version/3.0.1/overview) package.\\n\\n## Gren run\\n\\nAs a convenience, there is now a command to compile _and_ execute an application:\\n\\n```\\ngren run Main\\n```\\n\\nYou can use this as a simple way to run your test suite:\\n\\n```\\ngren run Tests\\n```\\n\\nThat might not sound like much, but if you add a `--package` flag, you'll be able to execute\\nhelper applications defined in packages, almost like using `npx` in the Node.js ecosystem.\\n\\nThis allows you to do things like define initializers for your package:\\n\\n```\\ngren run --package=xyz/cool-framework Setup\\n```\\n\\nAnd you do not need to be in a Gren project to run this!\\n\\n## Misc. changes\\n\\n`gren path` is a new command that prints paths that are important during compilation: the path to the current\\nproject, the backend binary being used and the cache folder.\\n\\nIn 24W we added a command, `gren make-static`, to allow you to create static executables. This command relied\\non some JavaScript dependencies used through ports, but since you cannot create static executables when ports\\nare involved, this meant that the compiler itself couldn't use this functionality. We've now removed this functionality\\nfrom the compiler itself, and instead published the [gren-make-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gren-make-static)\\npackage to NPM that provides the same functionality. In the future, we might ship static executable builds of the\\ncompiler through `nix`.\\n\\nWhile adding support for concurrent tasks, [Andrew MacMurray](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray) also found a way to optimize the execution of tasks\\nand commands. You can expect better performance when running a large number of tasks and commands.\\n\\nYou can now also unwrap [Cmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd) from a `Task x (Cmd a)` type using [Task.executeCmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task#executeCmd). This makes it possible\\nto end a [Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Task) chain with a [Cmd](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Platform.Cmd), giving you a limited way to combine such effects.\\n\\nMapping functions over more than three values (`map4`, `map5`, etc.) have been removed from most modules,\\nwith an exception made for the JSON modules. If you ever want to map more than three values at a time, we've\\nadded `andMap` to enable that.\\n\\nThere's a new module called [Stream.Log](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Stream.Log) that ignores any error that occurs when sending a value to the Stream.\\nIn general, we recommend that you only use this module for logging to the `stdout` or `stderr` streams, and use the regular `Stream`\\nmodule for most other cases where errors are more likely to occur.\\n\\n[Joey Bright](https://github.com/joeybright) has made several improvements to the [Crypto API](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/7.0.0/module/Crypto) in response to user feedback. There are no\\nnew features, but the types are more correct.\\n\\nYou can now listen for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals in applications targetting the `node` platform. You can\\nalso listen for the event where the JS event loop runs out of work.\\n\\nFilesystem errors now carries the relevant `Path`, which tends to be useful for error reporting or debugging.\\n\\n## What's next\\n\\nWith Gren 25S out the door, our attention shifts to 25W wich we aim to ship in December. The goal for that\\nrelease is to rewrite the language parser in Gren itself, re-introduce `gren format` and finish the\\ncentralized package registry.\\n\\nWith the parser rewrite, the AST will be made available in [compiler-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/compiler-node/version/3.0.1/overview). Formatting will be available\\nas a `AST -> String` function, which will also open the door for code generation.\\n\\n## Thank you, contributors!\\n\\nThis release was made through contributions from the following people:\\n\\n* [Andrew MacMurray](https://github.com/andrewMacmurray)\\n* [Jeroen Engels](https://github.com/jfmengels)\\n* [Joey Bright](https://github.com/joeybright)\\n* [Justin Blake](https://github.com/blaix) (core team)\\n* [Martin S Stewart](https://github.com/MartinSStewart)\\n* [Michael Paul Killian](https://github.com/michi-zuri)\\n* [Robin Heggelund Hansen](https://github.com/robinheghan) (core team)\\n\\n## Support the project\\n\\nYou can support Gren financially by [sponsoring us at ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/gren) or by [buying merch from the shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GrenProgramming?ref=gren-lang-dot-org).\\nThe profits allow members of the core team to take a day off from their day job and spend it developing\\nGren instead.\\n\\nBeing an open-source project, there are also other ways to contribute.

Gren is no longer developed by a single developer, but by a core team.\\n\\nFor the past couple of years I've been working on Gren by myself, with help from the small community that has formed around it. This has been a necessity, but it was never the goal. I'm of the belief that software, especially when used by a large and diverse set of users, is best developed in a team with developers of different expertise and experience. There are too many use- and edge cases for a single developer to predict them all.\\n\\nIt's vital that all members of a development team share the same philosophy and understanding of the software they are developing.

It's the responsibility of the core team to improve Gren in all of these aspects, and more.\\n\\nThe core team also serve as the decision makers for how the language will evolve in the future. That said, major changes to the language will continue to be discussed with the community prior to implementation.\\n\\nWith a core team in place, Gren is more resilient to failure and in a better position to grow.

Since Gren compiles to JavaScript, it's also possible to use the same tool for debugging Gren applications. The experience isn't great, however, as you're forced to debug the JavaScript that the compiler spits out instead of the actual code you wrote.\\n\\nUntil today, that is.\\n\\nGren 0.3.0 is now released, and with it comes the option of outputting source maps.\\n\\nSource maps is a JSON data structure that the JavaScript runtime can read in order to understand the relation between the currently running code, and the source code it orignated from.

The theme for Gren 0.3 is \\\"Testing and Debugging\\\", and Gren 0.2.1 delivers on the first half of this theme.\\n\\n## Local dependencies\\n\\nWith Gren 0.2 and earlier, you could only depend on packages which had a semver-formatted tag on github. For users of a package this works pretty well. For developers of a package, there isn't any easy way to test the package in a project _prior_ to publishing the tag.\\n\\nGren 0.2.1 adds support for local dependencies. Local dependencies are packages that reside on your local disk. Here's how you define a local dependency:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"type\\\": \\\"application\\\",\\n  \\\"platform\\\": \\\"node\\\",\\n  \\\"source-directories\\\": [\\n    \\\"src\\\"\\n  ],\\n  \\\"gren-version\\\": \\\"0.2.1\\\",\\n  \\\"dependencies\\\": {\\n    \\\"direct\\\": {\\n      \\\"gren-lang/node\\\": \\\"1.2.0\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/core\\\": \\\"local:..\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/test\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\n      \\\"gren-lang/test-runner-node\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"indirect\\\": {\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe above `gren.json` is taken from the `test` folder of [gren-lang/core](https://github.com/gren-lang/core). As you can see, `gren-lang/core` is here defined as local dependency where the package is defined to reside in the parent folder.\\n\\nLocal dependencies has several limitations. The compiler will refuse to compile dependencies which themselves have local dependencies, and `gren package validate` will fail if a local dependency is defined./a\\nGren will also refuse to compile local dependencies which contain kernel code, that isn't also part of a git commit signed by Gren's lead developer.\\n\\n## An official test framework\\n\\nGren now has two packages allowing you to test your implementation. \\n\\n[gren-lang/test](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/test) is a port of [elm-exploration/test](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest), and is a package for defining tests.\\n\\n[gren-lang/test-runner-node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/test-runner-node) allows you to define a Node.JS application that runs your defined tests.\\n\\nA minimal test program looks like the following:\\n\\n```gren\\nmodule Main exposing (main)\\n\\nimport Expect\\nimport Test exposing (Test, describe, test)\\nimport Test.Runner.Node exposing (Program, run)\\n\\nmain =\\n    run <|\\n        describe \\\"Tests\\\"\\n            [ test \\\"Always true\\\" <| \\\\_ ->\\n                Expect.pass\\n            ]\\n```\\n\\nTo run it, you need to do the following:\\n\\n```sh\\ngren compile src/Main.gren --output run_tests\\nnode run_tests\\n```\\n\\nIn order to write tests for your package, you can define a test application that imports your package as a local dependency.\\n\\nYou can see an example of this in [gren-lang/core](https://github.com/gren-lang/core/tree/e78cc321fc7521b87c0a60c04f5d911a9442db99/tests)'s test suite.\\n\\n## What's next\\n\\nThe next release will arrive this summer, and focus on code generation improvements for easier debugging and better performance. Hopefully, this release will also include support for generating source maps so that you can debug Gren code instead of the generated JavaScript.\\n\\nThat's it for now.

This list isn't exhaustive,  but gives a good impression of the direction of the language.\\n\\nIf you've got experience with Elm but are new to Gren, it might be a good idea to [read how Gren differs from Elm](https://gren-lang.org/book/appendix/faq/) before continuing.\\n\\n## New syntax for type aliases\\n\\nType aliases are going to become much more common in Gren (more on this later), and for that reason it might be worth reducing the keystrokes required to make them.\\n\\nThe syntax for defining a type alias will change from \\n\\n```\\ntype alias Named = { name : String }\\n```\\n\\nto\\n\\n```\\nNamed : { name : String }\\n```\\n\\nI first saw this syntax in [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org/) and it instantly felt like a good idea. Not only is it shorter, but it feels natural since it's exactly how you define the types of functions and values elsewhere.\\n\\n## Opaque aliases\\n\\nWhen defining custom types, you can decide between exposing just the name of the custom type, or the name as well as its constructors. We call the former opaque types. You can refer to the type, but you can't make any assumptions about what the type represents.\\n\\nWe're intending to allow for opaque type aliases. That is, you will be able to expose only the name of an alias, and not what it is an alias of. In the case of records, this means you no longer need to wrap a record in a custom type in order for it to be opaque.\\n\\n```\\nmodule Example exposing\\n  ( OpaqueRecord\\n  , ExposedRecord(..)\\n  )\\n  \\nOpaqueRecord : { secret : String }\\n\\nExposedRecord : { gossip : String }\\n```\\n\\nThe downside is that you need to add type annotations to any function that takes in or returns opaque values, otherwise the compiler will infer the literal (non-opaque) type.\\n\\n## Structural sum types\\n\\nCurrently, you can define sum types like this:\\n\\n```\\ntype Fruit\\n  = Apple\\n  | Banana\\n```\\n\\nThis type is nominal. You cannot define a function that accepts any type as long as it has an `Apple` constructor, or as long as it is a superset of `Fruit`. Neither can the compiler infer the type based on usage. It must be defined.\\n\\nThis is in contrast to how records work. Records are structural. You can define a function that works on any record as long as it has a specific set of fields. Records can be inferred. You can even define records as extensions of other records.\\n\\nGren intends to make sum types structural. As a consequence, we don\u2019t need a specific language construct for defining a sum type. Naming sum types can simply be done with aliases:\\n\\n```\\nFruit : | Apple | Banana\\n```\\n\\nNote the leading pipe symbol. It's what separates sum types from other types.\\n\\nThis is a feature that you'll also find in Roc, but I actually [first heard of the idea on the Elm discourse](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/idea-extensible-union-types-and-benefits-they-bring-for-real-world-elm-code/6118) back in 2020. Of course, it probably exists in a few other languages as well.\\n\\nWhile on the topic of sum types, Gren will further limit them to 0 or 1 arguments. The reasons behind this overlaps with [why tuples where removed](https://youtu.be/Sl9HHo1qDk0?si=wiJjSEMyl0f6HqTn), but there's also a performance argument to be made.\\n\\nBy making all sum type constructors take at most 1 argument, we can implement it as a simple object, which means the JavaScript engine will treat pattern matches on sum types as monomorphic code and optimize it well.\\n\\n## Parametric modules\\n\\nTo me, the biggest shortcoming of Elm (besides lacking first-class support for a server/terminal environment) is that you cannot easily store any given type as the key in a `Dict` or as an item in a `Set`. These types only accept things that are `comparable`, and that is a category you're not allowed to expand.\\n\\nThere are ways to work around this, sure, but considering how useful these data structures are it's a shame that you need to put in extra work in order to make full use of them.\\n\\nAnother thing that is a shame is that you're bound to `comparable`. Need the performance of a hash map? You now need to create a layer of abstraction for each type you'd like to store, or you would have to store the hash function in the instance of the data structure. If you choose the latter, running `==` on anything containing your hash map will crash at runtime.\\n\\nIn a statically typed language as strict as Elm, useful data structures like `Dict` and `Set` shouldn't nudge you towards primitive types.\\n\\nGren will at some point remove `appendable`, `comparable`, `number` and reflection-based functions like `==`. Instead, Gren will offer parametric modules.\\n\\nParametric modules allows you generate new modules at compile time. If you want a `Dict` that uses `MyType` as the key, you can generate that. If you want a `HashMap` where the key is an `(Array (Array Int))` you can generate that as well.\\n\\nIt will look something like the following:\\n\\n```\\nimport Dict MyType as MyTypeDict\\nimport Dict String as StringDict\\n```\\n\\n`MyTypeDict` and `StringDict` are two different modules, but generated based on the same template.\\n\\nIt's important to point out that `MyType` and `String` are not referring to types, but modules. It's possible to define a `ReverseCompareString` module that when passed as an argument to `Dict` will still use `String` as keys, but where the keys will be stored in reverse alphabetical order.\\n\\nYou can [read more about parametric modules on this github issue](https://github.com/gren-lang/compiler/issues/81).\\n\\nNow you might wonder: \\\"what's wrong with type classes?\\\"\\n\\nMy interpretation of why type classes never made it into Elm was because (1) it's hard to write good error messages when you are dealing with abstract types and interfaces and (2) it's easy to define and implement a type class that they have a habit of being used everywhere, even when there's no need.\\n\\nFor me, the biggest problem is that type classes form a global namespace. If someone implements a type class for a type, then no one else can provide a different implementation for that type, unless you're being clever/lucky with the imported modules. With parametric modules there is no global namespace. You can define three `Dict String`s, all with different comparison functions.\\n\\nI also think parametric modules require a bit of planning to use well, so they're not as likely to be used everywhere type classes are (which I consider a plus).\\n\\n## Overridable operators\\n\\nWithout type classes like `number`, `comparable` and `appendable`, we need to re-consider how operators work in Gren.\\n\\nThe current implementation of operators is a bit confusing. The language itself has support for custom operators, but it's locked down so that only the core team are allowed to use it.\\n\\nThe reasoning behind this is that custom operators can easily make code unreadable, as it's hard to remember the meaning of a foreign symbol and how they work regarding associativity and precedence. On the other hand, for mathematical expressions it's easier to read code that uses mathematical operators compared their function-based substitute. The limit on defining custom operators was meant to preserve a balance between too many and too few operators.\\n\\nUnfortunately, you can find several examples of unnecessary operators in Gren's own core packages, like the `url` package and the `parser` package. These operators don't make any sense outside of their respective packages, and I believe many people are annoyed that there are different rules for the general community and the core team.\\n\\nThe currently defined operators could also be more flexible. It makes perfect sense to allow a `BigInt` type to be used in mathematical expressions, or allow the `++` operator on any sequence-like data structure, even those defined in third-party packages.\\n\\nTo solve both of these problems, a future version of Gren will remove syntax for defining custom operators. Operators will be reduced to a fixed set and treated like (special) functions.\\n\\nLets look at an expression like `a + b`. What is `+` in this case? In the future that will depend on what you have in scope. If you have an import statement like `import Int exposing (+)`, then `a + b` will represent integer addition.\\n\\nYou can define your own implementation of `+`:\\n\\n```\\n(+) : BigInt -> BigInt -> BigInt\\n(+) a b =\\n  (BigInt.toInt a) Int.+ (BigInt.toInt b)\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, we'll also allow qualified operators like `Int.+` so that it's possible to refer to different implementations of a given operator within a module.\\n\\nIt's important to note that you won't be allowed to define entirely new operators, or redefine precedence and associativity rules for existing ones. \\n\\n## Wrapping up\\n\\nAs mentioned, these are features I'm certain will make it into the language in the next couple of years. Most, if not all, of these will arrive when the parser is rewritten in Gren.\\n\\nIf you'd like to keep updated on the progress on these and other language features feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Chb9YB9Vmh).\\n\"}","2331668781":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren-in-Gren, and other developments\",\"published\":\"2024-03-21\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nThe first few lines of a new Gren compiler are being written this week. The goal is to better support upcoming features of the language, as well as being easier to maintain and debug. The hope is also that it will be easier for the community to contribute, as the new compiler is being written in Gren itself.\\n\\nThe goal is to rewrite the compiler incrementally and release each new piece of the compiler as it is ready. You can still expect new features every six months,\\nand the first version of the compiler that contains Gren code will be Gren 0.4, scheduled for June.\\n\\nFor more details on Gren-in-Gren, check out the YouTube video below.\\n\\n[![Robin and Justin demoing new functionality](https://img.youtube.com/vi/t6TVmM_664o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6TVmM_664o)\\n\\n## HttpClient for Node.js based applications\\n\\nIn addition to Gren-in-Gren, the video also demos the new HttpClient API in [gren-lang/node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/3.2.0/overview). This means that you can now create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests\\nwhen writing Gren applications that target the node platform.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, [Justin Blake](https://github.com/blaix) shows up in the video to demo the new [Prettynice web framework](https://github.com/blaix/prettynice) for Gren, that makes it easy to write a Gren-based backend with Gren-based components\\non the frontend.\\n\\n## Improved core packages\\n\\nGren's core packages (`gren-lang/core`, `gren-lang/node` and `gren-lang/browser`) have all been updated. Besides the already mentioned HttpClient API for node, the `gren-lang/web-storage` package has been consolidated\\nwith `gren-lang/browser`, and several bugs have been squashed. The documentation has also been updated to be easier to read.\\n\\nHere's a few notable bugs that have been fixed:\\n\\n* We correctly refer to the _Elm_ architecture in our documentation. This was incorrectly renamed to the Gren architecture in the initial days of the project.\\n* The time-travelling debugger failed to show up in browser applications.\\n* The time-travelling debugger overlay now has a class attached, so you can easily hide or move it using CSS.\\n* `Bytes` now work with `==`\\n* `Regex.fromString \\\"\\\"` now returns `Nothing`\\n* `logBase 10` is now more precise by utilizing the JavaScript builtin `Math.log10` function. `logBase 10 1000` now returns 3, as you'd expect.\\n* The `String` API now makes no attempt to concatenate UTF-16 surrogate pairs. Gren strings are now plain old JavaScript strings. This should improve performance, and fix a few bugs, at the cost of not being more like JavaScript.\\n\"}","2384614171":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren 0.2: Hello, NodeJS\",\"published\":\"2022-12-12\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nSix months after the release of 0.1, a new release is here with a bunch of exciting features. This includes a built-in code formatter and basic support for creating applications that run on NodeJS.\\n\\n## Platforms\\n\\nWhen defining new projects, you now need to specify which platform you're targeting. There are three platforms to choose from: `common`, `browser` and `node`. The latter two decide where the application can run, wheras the `common` platform indicates that your code can run anywhere. In other words, packages targeting the `common` platform can be dependencies of either `browser` and `node` projects.\\n\\nIn practical terms, the platform setting decides which core packages you're allowed to depend on. If you're targeting the `browser` platform, you're _not_ allowed to depend on `gren-lang/node`, directly or indirectly. Likewise, a project targeting the `node` platform is forbidden from depending on `gren-lang/browser`. When targeting the `common` platform, you can depend on neither.\\n\\nIn order to make it easier to setup a project correctly, we've added two flags to the `gren init` command: `--package` and `--platform`. For instance, if you want to create a package project targeting the `node` platform, you can run:\\n\\n```sh\\ngren init --package --platform node\\n```\\n\\nIf you'd rather create a `node` application, then just leave out the `--package` flag.\\n\\nThe long-term goal is to support all built-in NodeJS API's, but currently we only support a small subset. To get a better idea of what's possible you can read the [gren-lang/node documentation](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node) or take a look at the [cat example program](https://github.com/gren-lang/example-projects/tree/main/cat).\\n\\nYou might also want to take a look at this [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGEOvIHDlBI) where Robin implements the unix echo program in Gren.\\n\\n## Formatting\\n\\nAaron VonderHaar, the author of `elm-format`, was working on a formatting tool for Gren before 0.1 was even released. With Gren 0.2, this tool is now ready to use.\\n\\nTo format your project, simply run `gren format`. To validate the formatting of a project, just run `gren format --validate`.\\n\\nWhile the formatter should work well enough for most projects, it's not finished. Bugs and less-than-stellar formatting is to be expected in some cases. If you come across any interesting behaviour, please let us know.\\n\\n## Package consolidation\\n\\nSeveral different packages have now been consolidated into fewer, but bigger packages. For example: `gren-lang/virtual-dom`, `gren-lang/html` and `gren-lang/svg` are now merged into `gren-lang/browser`.\\n\\nThe main reason for doing this has to do with project management. It's easier for me to deal with 5 bug trackers than 15, and it takes less time to migrate and publish 5 packages to Gren 0.2, instead of 15.\\n\\nAt the same time, there aren't really any downsides to developers. Fewer packages means less time being spent downloading packages, and since Gren has excellent dead-code elimination, your compiled output isn't getting bigger either.\\n\\nEverything hasn't been consolidated, though. `gren-lang/url`, `gren-lang/parser` and `gren-lang/web-storage` do still exist and will continue to do so until I'm certain that their API is stable enough to be consolidated into one of the \\\"big three\\\" packages.\\n\\nGoing forward, new functionality is likely to be introduced in standalone packages, then become merged into the right platform package when the API has stabilized.\\n\\n## Package management\\n\\nThe package manager has improved in almost every way.\\n\\nIt is now significantly faster, gives detailed error messages when you have incompatible dependencies in your project, and has learned a few new tricks to make it easier to manage your dependencies.\\n\\nThere's now a `gren package uninstall` command for removing a dependency from your project, as well as `gren package outdated` for seeing which dependencies are out of date.\\n\\n## New language features\\n\\nGren 0.2 also brings a few new language features. These don't radically change the language in any way, but provide small quality-of-life improvements.\\n\\n### Record update now works on any expression\\n\\nIn 0.1, record update syntax only worked on variable names, like this:\\n\\n```gren\\noriginalRecord = { value = \\\"original\\\" }\\n\\nupdatedRecord = { originalRecord | value = \\\"updated\\\" }\\n```\\n\\nHowever, any other expression isn't legal. So you can't do things like this:\\n\\n```gren\\nupdatedRecord = { OtherModule.originalRecord | value = \\\"updated\\\" }\\n```\\n\\nThis is one of the only places where we have such limitations. For instance, we don't limit what expressions you can have in `if` expressions or `case` expressions, or even inside literals. So it's confusing when a limitation like this exists.\\n\\nIn 0.2, you can now use record update syntax with _any_ expression. The above snippet will now compile, but so will much more complex expressions.\\n\\nThis change was contributed by Julian Antonielli.\\n\\n### Import aliases can now contain dots\\n\\nExactly what it says on the tin, the following import statement is now legal:\\n\\n```gren\\nimport Much.Nested.Module.Path as Nested.Path\\n```\\n\\n### Named unused constants\\n\\nWhen pattern matching or defining functions, you can use `_` to ignore a value. Here's an example:\\n\\n```gren\\nlength : Array a -> Int\\nlength array =\\n    Array.foldl (\\\\_ len -> len + 1) 0 array\\n```\\n\\nSometimes, it can be helpful to attach a name to the ignored value, as a reminder for what the value represents. In 0.2, you can do just that:\\n\\n```gren\\nlength : Array a -> Int\\nlength array =\\n    Array.foldl (\\\\_value len -> len + 1) 0 array\\n```\\n\\nNote: trying to use `_value` will trigger a compilation error.\\n\\nThis feature was contributed by Allan Clark.\\n\\n### Multi-line strings trims leading whitespace\\n\\nGren has dedicated syntax for defining a multi-line string. It looks like this:\\n\\n```gren\\nstr =\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    this\\n      is a\\n    string\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn 0.1, this is equivalent to\\n\\n```gren\\nstr = \\\"\\\\n    this\\\\n      is a\\\\n    string\\\\n\\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn 0.2, multi-line strings trims away a common number of leading whitespace on each line, so that the multi-line string compiles to the equivalent of:\\n\\n```gren\\nstr = \\\"this\\\\n  is a\\\\nstring\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## What's next?\\n\\nThe 0.2 release is a big release, but we have no intention of stopping here. The 0.3 release will focus on testing & debugging, and will include features such as an official test framework, source maps for viewing Gren code in a JavaScript debugger and improved code generation.\\n\\nSince Gren will continue with its six-month release cadence, 0.3 is scheduled for release in June 2023.\\n\\nThat's it for now.

There are some changes in syntax, an option for compiling to a static executable, a rewrite of the Stream and String modules and parts of the compiler are now available in package form.\\n\\n## What is this 24W thing?\\n\\n[![Robin gave a demo on some of the features in 24W](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eNx-2jSbejI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx-2jSbejI)\\n\\nJune and December each year is when we do backward incompatible releases of the compiler and the core packages. Since each of these components have their own version\\nit hasn't been completely clear what to call a specific release.\\n\\nFrom now on we'll refer to a set of packages based on when they were released. 24W, or the 2024 Winter release, consist of the following software:\\n\\n* compiler v0.5.0\\n* gren-lang/core v6.0.0\\n* gren-lang/browser v5.0.0\\n* gren-lang/node v5.0.0\\n\\n## Syntax changes\\n\\n`case of` has now been renamed to `when is`. That means that code like this:\\n\\n```gren\\ncase String.toInt \\\"42\\\" of\\n  Just num ->\\n    \\\"The string is a valid integer.\\\"\\n\\n  Nothing ->\\n    \\\"The string is _not_ a valid integer.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nMust now be written as:\\n\\n```gren\\nwhen String.toInt \\\"42\\\" is\\n  Just num ->\\n    \\\"The string is a valid integer.\\\"\\n\\n  Nothing ->\\n    \\\"The string is _not_ a valid integer.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe rationale here is simply that `when is` reads better.\\n\\nA change with bigger impact is that custom types are now limited to either 0 or 1 parameters, where they previously could have many more.\\n\\nCode like this is no longer valid:\\n\\n```gren\\ntype Person = Person String Int\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to associate multiple fields with a variant, you can use a record instead:\\n\\n```gren\\ntype Person = Person { name : String, age : Int }\\n```\\n\\nThe reasoning is the same as what lead to the [removal of tuples](https://youtu.be/Sl9HHo1qDk0?si=wiJjSEMyl0f6HqTn). Positional parameters\\nleads to cryptic and brittle code where named parameters don't.\\n\\n## Static executables\\n\\nThe rewrite of the compiler from Haskell to Gren continues at a slow but steady pace. In 24W the command line interface\\nof the compiler has been rewritten to Gren. As we like to add new features while doing a rewrite, there's now a new command that gives you the\\noption of compiling a Gren program to a static executable.\\n\\nIf you compile a program with `make-static` a couple of interesting things will happen.\\n\\nFirst, it will compile your program to a JavaScript bundle using the `--optimize` flag. This bundle will then be executed in the NodeJS\\ninstance you're using to run the Gren compiler, stopping just shy of invoking the main function. The in-memory representation of your\\nprogram at this point will be saved to disk as a snapshot, and then injected into a copy of the NodeJS executable.\\n\\nWhen executed, your program will start up faster, as much of the costs associated with initialization -- like parsing\\nJavaScript, evaluating constants etc. -- has already been done when building the snapshot.\\n\\nHow much faster your static executable will run depends on the size of your program. We've seen anything from 10-25% improvement in startup time.\\n\\nRobin held a demo of this feature in [A Tour of Gren 24W](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx-2jSbejI&t=1080s).\\n\\n## Stream rewrite\\n\\nWhen reading a large file from the filesystem, or when retrieving a large payload over HTTP, you typically receive a couple kilobytes at a time instead of the entire thing all at once.\\nStreams allows you to perform operations on these chunks as they come in, instead of waiting to perform the operation until you have the entire payload, saving both time and memory.\\n\\nIn 24S there was a `Stream` module in `gren-lang/node`, but functionality was limited to simple reads and writes and the only available streams where the standard input streams for communicating with the terminal.\\n\\nFor 24W the `Stream` module has been completely rewritten, giving you the possibility of defining your own streams over arbitrary types, and the option of combining several streams to a single pipeline.\\nThe module has also moved to `gren-lang/core`, meaning you can use streams no matter which platform you're targetting.\\n\\nThis new `Stream` implementation is based on Web Streams, which gives us access to some native stream transformations like compression/\\ndecompression and converting between strings and bytes.\\n\\nYou can also use stream pairs to create a line of communication between different parts of your code.\\n\\nFor more information you can [read the documentation of the `Stream` module](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/6.0.0/module/Stream).\\n\\n## String rewrite\\n\\nThe `String` module has been rewritten so that all functions, unless otherwise noted, deal with code points as opposed\\nto character units. Code points is a variable sized representation of a unicode character, consisting of 1 or 2 character units.\\nThis change makes it less likely that you'll unintentionally operate on half a character, at cost of performance for certain\\noperations.\\n\\nOn top of that, some functions have been introduce and some have been renamed, to be more in line with other modules like\\n`Array` and `Dict`.\\n\\n## Misc. changes\\n\\n* All functions named `filter` have been renamed to `keepIf`. Similarly, `filterMap` has been\\nrenamed to `mapAndKeepJust` and `flatMap` to `mapAndFlatten`.\\n* Functions named `length` are expected to return in constant time. Where this isn't the case, the function\\nhas been renamed to `count`.\\n* `Node.endWithCmd` has been replaced with `Node.endSimpleProgram`.\\n* The time-travelling debugger has been removed.\\n* The `ChildProcess` module has seen some incremental changes to fix a design mistake and to support streams for communication between processes.\\n* The `FileSystem` module now has functions for opening files as streams.\\n* Fixed a few sourcemapping bugs when compiling on a Windows system.\\n\\n## Thank you, contributors\\n\\nThis release was made possible through contributions from the following people:\\n\\n* [Axel Baudot](https://github.com/axelbdt)\\n* [mbartlett21](https://github.com/mbartlett21)\\n* [Justin Blake](https://github.com/blaix)\\n* [Patrick Bollinger](https://github.com/pjbollinger)\\n* [Robin Heggelund Hansen](https://github.com/robinheghan)\\n\"}","2885376689":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Documentation as a first class citizen\",\"published\":\"2022-08-22\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nA crucial aspect of any programming language, is how easy it is to discover and learn new functionality.\\n\\nOne of the most common questions asked since [Gren's first release](/news/220530_first_release) is \\\"what can I do with Gren?\\\" and \\\"where can I see what's in the core package?

Function names now show up for uncurried function calls, and you\u2019ll see a lot less application helpers (A2, A3, A4...).\\n\\nSourcemaps now also include the location of anonymous functions, which again improves the accuracy of the call stack while debugging.\\n\\nA bug causing wrong line numbers for NodeJS applications have been fixed, as has a bug omitting the last line of the sourcemap.\\n\\n## Web Crypto\\n\\nGren programs now have access to the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API). This lets you sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt `Bytes`, as well as generate UUIDv4 strings and random `Bytes` with a secure algorithm.\\n\\nThe [Crypto](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Crypto) module was implemented by Joey Bright, marking his first contribution to the core packages.\\n\\n## A note on the ChildProcess API\\n\\nThere\u2019s a bug in the 0.4.4 compiler where the exit code is always zero, even when compilation fails.\\n\\nThis stems from missing functionality in the [ChildProcess](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/4.2.0/module/ChildProcess) module. In order to fix this issue in a backwards compatible way, Justin Blake has added a new function called [ChildProcess.spawnAndNotifyOnExit](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/4.2.0/module/ChildProcess#spawnAndNotifyOnExit) which works exactly like [ChildProcess.spawn](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/4.2.0/module/ChildProcess#spawn) except that it notifies the application when the child process exits and which code it exited with.\\n\\nThis is just a temporary fix. We intend to rewrite the [ChildProcess](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/4.2.0/module/ChildProcess) module in the next major release in order to clean up the API and add new functionality.\\n\\n## New functions\\n\\nBesides the new [Array.Builder](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array.Builder) and [Crypto](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Crypto) modules, existing modules have been updated with new functions:\\n\\n* [Array.insert](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#insert)\\n* [Array.insertMany](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#insertMany)\\n* [Array.remove](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#remove)\\n* [Array.removeMany](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#removeMany)\\n* [Array.setMany](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#setMany)\\n* [Array.splice](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Array#splice)\\n* [Bitwise.countLeadingZeros](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Bitwise#countLeadingZeros)\\n* [Dict.updateWithDefault](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Dict#updateWithDefault)\\n* [Math.maxFloat](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Math#maxFloat)\\n* [Math.maxSafeInteger](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Math#maxSafeInteger)\\n* [Math.minFloat](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Math#minFloat)\\n* [Math.minSafeInteger](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Math#minSafeInteger)\\n* [Maybe.checkValue](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Maybe#checkValue)\\n* [Maybe.filter](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Maybe#filter)\\n* [Maybe.hasValue](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Maybe#hasValue)\\n* [Maybe.withDefaultLazy](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Maybe#withDefaultLazy)\\n* [Result.allOk](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#allOk)\\n* [Result.checkValue](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#checkValue)\\n* [Result.firstOk](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#firstOk)\\n* [Result.hasValue](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#hasValue)\\n* [Result.onError](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#onError)\\n* [Result.withDefaultLazy](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Result#withDefaultLazy)\\n* [Set.toggle](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/5.1.0/module/Set#toggle)\\n\"}","3799345669":"{\"parsedFrontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Gren 0.4: New foundations\",\"published\":\"2024-06-24\"},\"withoutFrontmatter\":\"\\nThe core packages have been updated with new functionality and quality-of-life improvements. The compiler has started its transition from Haskell to Gren. The book has seen a face lift, and Zulip has been replaced by Discord.\\n\\nInterested? Let's dig in.\\n\\n## New filesystem API\\n\\n[![Robin demonstrates the new FileSystem API](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fwLP6WVLJWU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwLP6WVLJWU)\\n\\nThe FileSystem API was functional, but minimal. It has been replaced by three new modules: `FileSystem`, `FileSystem.FileHandle` and `FileSystem.Path`.\\n\\n* `FileSystem` contains functions for working with the file system.\\n* `FileSystem.FileHandle` allows you to open a file, perform several operations on it and then close it again.\\n* `FileSystem.Path` gives you a statically typed, cross-platform, representation of a file system path.\\n\\nTogether, these modules give you access to most of the file system operations available in NodeJS.\\n\\nIf you want more information about the new FileSystem API, be sure to watch the video linked above.\\n\\n## Gren-in-Gren\\n\\nThis release contains the first few lines of what will eventually be a ground-up rewrite of the compiler in Gren. While\\nit currently does little more than downloading and executing the Haskell-based compiler, it will eventually enable the\\nuse of compiler functionality (parsing, type checking, formatting) in Gren applications.\\n\\nThere are also several indirect benefits of the Gren-in-Gren rewrite, like lowering the barrier of contributing to the\\ncompiler, and improving the quality of the Gren core packages by virtue of compiler authors now also being Gren-developers.\\n\\nIn fact, the mentioned rewrite of the FileSystem API is a direct consequence of the compiler needing more functionality\\nthan what was previously available.\\n\\nWe'll talk more about the importance of Gren-in-Gren at a later time.\\n\\n## The book has received a face lift\\n\\nJustin Blake has contributed big changes to [the book](https://gren-lang.org/book), which serves as our language guide.\\n\\nNot only has he filled in empty chapters and added a few new ones, he's also replaced the generator with Astro Starlight.\\nOne of the biggest consequences of this change is that you can now search for topics of interest.\\n\\n## We've moved to Discord\\n\\nSince the very first release of Gren we've been using Zulip to coordinate development of the language. Over time we've received feedback\\nthat Zulip might not have been the best choice. Many people feel that they're drowning in communication platforms, so the bar for joining\\nyet another platform is pretty high.\\n\\nWhile our experience with Zulip has been good, the future success of Gren depends on an active community.\\nUsing the best tool means nothing if we're using it alone.\\n\\nWe've now decided to use [Discord](https://discord.gg/Chb9YB9Vmh) for discussing and sharing all things related to Gren. Why don't you join us?\\n\\n## Misc. changes\\n\\n* Using multi-line string syntax for a single-line string is now a compile error.\\n* If the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, color will be stripped from the compiler output.\\n* `Stream.sendX` and `Node.exit` functions are now `Task`-based. This makes them easier to compose with other `Task`s.\\n* You now have access to the location of the current executing program.\\n* You can now set the title of the currently running process.\\n* Removed `always`, use anonymous functions instead.\\n* `Bytes` now have convenience functions for converting between `Bytes` and `String`.\\n* `Bytes.join` allow you to build `Bytes` from `Array Bytes`. Useful when retrieving several `Bytes` from `HttpClient`.\\n* Performance improvements of several `Array` functions.\\n* Added `Array.indexedFold`.\\n* Added several new functions to `Dict` and `Set`.\\n* Removed `Dict.fromArray`. Use a pipeline of `Dict.set`, or `Dict.set` in a `fold`.\\n* Added `Task.execute` to run a `Task` without triggering a message to your application's `update` function.\\n* Added `Task.await` for imperative-style composition of `Task`s.\\n\\n## Thank you, contributors\\n\\nThis release was made possible through contributions from the following people:\\n\\n* [CharlonTank](https://github.com/CharlonTank)\\n* [Gaute Berge](https://github.com/Gauteab)\\n* [Justin Blake](https://github.com/blaix)\\n* [pushfoo](https://github.com/pushfoo)\\n* [Revath S Kumar](https://github.com/revathskumar)\\n* [Robin Heggelund Hansen](https://github.com/robinheghan)\\n\"}"},"is404":false,"path":"news/161224_gren_24w"}</script>

There are some changes in syntax, an option for compiling to a static executable, a rewrite of the Stream and String modules and parts of the compiler are now available in package form.</p><h2>What is this 24W thing?</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx-2jSbejI"><img alt="Robin gave a demo on some of the features in 24W" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/eNx-2jSbejI/0.jpg"></a></p><p>June and December each year is when we do backward incompatible releases of the compiler and the core packages. Since each of these components have their own version
it hasn&#039;t been completely clear what to call a specific release.</p><p>From now on we&#039;ll refer to a set of packages based on when they were released. 24W, or the 2024 Winter release, consist of the following software:</p><ul><li>compiler v0.5.0</li><li>gren-lang/core v6.0.0</li><li>gren-lang/browser v5.0.0</li><li>gren-lang/node v5.0.0</li></ul><h2>Syntax changes</h2><p><code>case of</code> has now been renamed to <code>when is</code>. That means that code like this:</p><pre><code class="language-gren">case String.toInt &quot;42&quot; of
  Just num -&gt;
    &quot;The string is a valid integer.&quot;

  Nothing -&gt;
    &quot;The string is _not_ a valid integer.&quot;
</code></pre><p>Must now be written as:</p><pre><code class="language-gren">when String.toInt &quot;42&quot; is
  Just num -&gt;
    &quot;The string is a valid integer.&quot;

  Nothing -&gt;
    &quot;The string is _not_ a valid integer.&quot;
</code></pre><p>The rationale here is simply that <code>when is</code> reads better.</p><p>A change with bigger impact is that custom types are now limited to either 0 or 1 parameters, where they previously could have many more.</p><p>Code like this is no longer valid:</p><pre><code class="language-gren">type Person = Person String Int
</code></pre><p>If you want to associate multiple fields with a variant, you can use a record instead:</p><pre><code class="language-gren">type Person = Person { name : String, age : Int }
</code></pre><p>The reasoning is the same as what lead to the <a href="https://youtu.be/Sl9HHo1qDk0?si=wiJjSEMyl0f6HqTn">removal of tuples</a>. Positional parameters
leads to cryptic and brittle code where named parameters don&#039;t.</p><h2>Static executables</h2><p>The rewrite of the compiler from Haskell to Gren continues at a slow but steady pace. In 24W the command line interface
of the compiler has been rewritten to Gren. As we like to add new features while doing a rewrite, there&#039;s now a new command that gives you the
option of compiling a Gren program to a static executable.</p><p>If you compile a program with <code>make-static</code> a couple of interesting things will happen.</p><p>First, it will compile your program to a JavaScript bundle using the <code>--optimize</code> flag. This bundle will then be executed in the NodeJS
instance you&#039;re using to run the Gren compiler, stopping just shy of invoking the main function. The in-memory representation of your
program at this point will be saved to disk as a snapshot, and then injected into a copy of the NodeJS executable.</p><p>When executed, your program will start up faster, as much of the costs associated with initialization -- like parsing
JavaScript, evaluating constants etc. -- has already been done when building the snapshot.</p><p>How much faster your static executable will run depends on the size of your program. We&#039;ve seen anything from 10-25% improvement in startup time.</p><p>Robin held a demo of this feature in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNx-2jSbejI&t=1080s">A Tour of Gren 24W</a>.</p><h2>Stream rewrite</h2><p>When reading a large file from the filesystem, or when retrieving a large payload over HTTP, you typically receive a couple kilobytes at a time instead of the entire thing all at once.
Streams allows you to perform operations on these chunks as they come in, instead of waiting to perform the operation until you have the entire payload, saving both time and memory.</p><p>In 24S there was a <code>Stream</code> module in <code>gren-lang/node</code>, but functionality was limited to simple reads and writes and the only available streams where the standard input streams for communicating with the terminal.</p><p>For 24W the <code>Stream</code> module has been completely rewritten, giving you the possibility of defining your own streams over arbitrary types, and the option of combining several streams to a single pipeline.
The module has also moved to <code>gren-lang/core</code>, meaning you can use streams no matter which platform you&#039;re targetting.</p><p>This new <code>Stream</code> implementation is based on Web Streams, which gives us access to some native stream transformations like compression/
decompression and converting between strings and bytes.</p><p>You can also use stream pairs to create a line of communication between different parts of your code.</p><p>For more information you can <a href="https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/6.0.0/module/Stream">read the documentation of the <code>Stream</code> module</a>.</p><h2>String rewrite</h2><p>The <code>String</code> module has been rewritten so that all functions, unless otherwise noted, deal with code points as opposed
to character units. Code points is a variable sized representation of a unicode character, consisting of 1 or 2 character units.
This change makes it less likely that you&#039;ll unintentionally operate on half a character, at cost of performance for certain
operations.</p><p>On top of that, some functions have been introduce and some have been renamed, to be more in line with other modules like
<code>Array</code> and <code>Dict</code>.</p><h2>Misc. changes</h2><ul><li>All functions named <code>filter</code> have been renamed to <code>keepIf</code>. Similarly, <code>filterMap</code> has been
renamed to <code>mapAndKeepJust</code> and <code>flatMap</code> to <code>mapAndFlatten</code>.</li><li>Functions named <code>length</code> are expected to return in constant time. Where this isn&#039;t the case, the function
has been renamed to <code>count</code>.</li><li><code>Node.endWithCmd</code> has been replaced with <code>Node.endSimpleProgram</code>.</li><li>The time-travelling debugger has been removed.</li><li>The <code>ChildProcess</code> module has seen some incremental changes to fix a design mistake and to support streams for communication between processes.</li><li>The <code>FileSystem</code> module now has functions for opening files as streams.</li><li>Fixed a few sourcemapping bugs when compiling on a Windows system.</li></ul><h2>Thank you, contributors</h2><p>This release was made possible through contributions from the following people:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/axelbdt">Axel Baudot</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mbartlett21">mbartlett21</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/blaix">Justin Blake</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/pjbollinger">Patrick Bollinger</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/robinheghan">Robin Heggelund Hansen</a></li></ul></section><footer><small class="container">Copyright © 2022 - present, The Gren Contributors</small></footer></main>
